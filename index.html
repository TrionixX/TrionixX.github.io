                   Between 2014 and 2015, Joaquin Phoenix expressed 
                   interest to his agent in acting in a low-budget 
                   "character study" type of film about a comic book 
                   villain, like DC Comics character the Joker. Phoenix 
                   had thought of the idea 1 to 2 years before Phillips 
                   conceived Joker in 2016. Phoenix had previously 
                   declined to act in the Marvel Cinematic Universe because 
                   he would have been required to reprise a role, such as 
                   the Hulk (initially portrayed by Edward Norton before he 
                   was recast by Mark Ruffalo) or Doctor Strange, in 
                   multiple films. Phoenix ruled out the Joker for his 
                   "character study" idea and tried to think of a different 
                   one. "I thought, 'You can't do the Joker, because, you 
                   know, it's just you can't do that character, it's just 
                   been done.'" Phoenix's agent suggested setting up an 
                   exploratory meeting with Warner Bros., but he declined 
                   and let go of the idea. Similarly, Todd Phillips had 
                   been offered to direct comic-based films a number of 
                   times, but declined because he thought they were "loud" 
                   and did not interest him. According to Phillips, Joker 
                   was created from his idea to create a different, more 
                   grounded comic book film. He was attracted to the 
                   Joker because he did not think there was a definitive 
                   portrayal of the character, which he knew wo
                   uld provide considerable creative freedom.
